# Web API Basics

Ideally, you should feel confident being able to answer the following questions when we are done today:

1. What is the purpose of a web API?
2. What does a web API do? (i.e. how does a web API function?)
3. How you you feed instructions and information to a web API?
4. How can I use the response data returned from an API request?
